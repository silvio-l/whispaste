/// Pure title-derivation helper for history entries.

/// A history entry's title starts as an automatic derivation of its content

/// manually renamed the entry (`HistoryEntry.titleEdited == false`, see the
/// `title_edited` column doc comment in `lib/core/data/tables.dart`). Once
/// `titleEdited` flips true the title is user-owned and this function is no
/// longer applied to that entry.
